THIS repo just a small example to compare two docx files under some headings.
Used **Python-docx**
- It can be genralized for whole docs.
- Formatting is maintained for text and table 
- tables are recursively added at the end of heading (Limitation)

Inspired from StackExchange and git issues. Feels free to use if necessary.
