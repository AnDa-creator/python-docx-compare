# THIS repo is just a small example to compare two docx files under some headings.
## Used **Python-docx**
Some of the characteristics are: 
- It can be generalized for whole docs.
- Formatting is maintained for text and table 
- tables are recursively added at the end of the heading (Limitation)

Inspired by StackExchange and git issues. Feels free to use if necessary.
